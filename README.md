Before you can install the Angular, check you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) and the [Node Package Manager (NPM)](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your PC. In a terminal window or an IDEâ€™s integrated terminal, type the following:

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Note that I had issues running the Angular proxy. Therefore, I advise running viewing the project by opening a browser window with the following command:

`open -n -a /Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --args --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_test" --disable-web-security --allow-running-insecure-content`

In the new Chrome window, Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
